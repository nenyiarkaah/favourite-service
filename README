This is a practice run through a talk I'm giving at Applicative Conf in NYC on Friday.
This is an abridge version just focusing on getting the microservice running.
For the mysql database I am using a docker container.
The command is `docker run --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql`
And to access the database
url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysql
user: root
password: password
